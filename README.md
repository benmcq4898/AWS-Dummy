# My COE Project

This repository is to show the technical ability of myself, and also to automate the various services of AWS e.g S3, EC2, CloudFormation, Route 53.

## Prerequisites:
```bash
npm install npm@latest -g
```

## Usage:
- Create a CloudFormation stack by copy and pasting main.yaml into the Infrastructure Composer when creating a new template.
- Once the stack has been created successfully, check that the various resources have been created.
- Open your command line tool and install npm if needed.
- Use portforwarding to connect to the private EC2 instance.
- Run npm for the webpage to become publically accessible.
- Navigate to the webpage to check on availability.
